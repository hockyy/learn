1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,300
ני 咩?


2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,500
How come someone licked it?


3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,360
Give some!


4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,040
Ah you hell!


5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,900
I asked Ah Sinni...


6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
He appreciates where we finally spent the most?!


7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
As for Sinni, it's like my two side boys, okay?


8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,580
OK!


9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,730
Brother Shu, one word, the fate is stable and pure, Brother Shu!


10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,650
It's early, brother!


11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,530
Ximi, I, I like to set it, myself.


12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,010
I want to say brother, why are you here?


13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,710
Gao Ning type microphone?


14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,350
Tall, beautiful, fat again!


15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,030
By the way, Gao Ning is going to take care of your body today and go to the hospital for treatment.


16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,190
So let's replace him...


17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,370
Also, I know you guys come to Namco to shoot, I want to go to Namco too.


18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,370
So we came to Namco.


19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,910
Because our episode is sponsored by Namco!


20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,870
Yes, we are about to have a series of competitions inside...


21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,190
Hey, we've been grouped, right?


22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,070
There is a mistake!


23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,050
we are...


24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,730
Student Union!


25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,770
We are the four most outstanding students you have selected...


26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,090
It doesn't seem to vote, are not back.


27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,850
I choose your opponents...


28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,230
What did you do to choose my opponent?


29
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,330
Why did you choose my opponent?


30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,650
I got it!


31
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:20,850
I got it!


32
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,350
Yes, lick your hands right now...


33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,790
I am a recipient of the Financial Step Award.


34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,710
Tong Xiaotongla.


35
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,230
I'm the worst in the school...


36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,210
I'm with Xiaotong.


37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,470
I can't walk away...


38
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,030
You are on your body too...


39
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,710
I am the winner of Bubu Award.


40
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,690
Hsiao-tung and I are in peace...


41
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,570
Nine things, nine things.


42
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,130
Ok, I'm Ka-lai-ying Peng, the clerk...


43
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,670
Order it?


44
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,730
Pang Ka-lai-ying, so I can guess who will be next...


45
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,890
I am the president of the student union, Chairman Zhu.


46
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,130
This is Chairman Zhu.


47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,550
You said it's not easy...


48
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,190
I'm just trying my best...


49
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,930
Never like to be alone.


50
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,450
It's a pity that I am alone.


51
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,750
I'm not...enough, okay?


52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,410
Let's go south to China Southern Airlines.


53
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,410
My name is John, and my name is Guan Yannuo.


54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,670
Wood flute, Tenai.


55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,650
Hands straight.


56
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,490
Thank you, thank you.


57
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,890
I'm scared, I was really scared...


58
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,930
I'm a beetroot from the dragon hair family...


59
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,090
why is it so tight


60
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,430
I got some beets and dyed my hair.


61
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,210
Because what identity we are waiting for.


62
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,690
What exactly is beetroot?


63
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,130
Beetroot is my name...


64
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,530
I am a fortune teller at the Astrology Society.


65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,430
Fortune teller, tell me if I won or lost today...


66
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,430
Lose?


67
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,990
Win.


68
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,510
I'm the most obedient in the school.


69
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,270
President of the Xiangqi Society and International Chess Society.


70
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,330
My name is Cheng Shuang.


71
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,710
Cheng Shuang.


72
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,870
Wow, she's been bandaged for a long time...


73
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,450
So you thought you pressed me...


74
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,350
My name is Cheng Shuang.


75
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,630
Well, let’s not talk so much.


76
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,990
Let's go into Namco and play right away.


77
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,710
"Happy Solutions".


78
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,110
Check out the rules of the game now...


79
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,350
Clamp the doll to pass three levels.


80
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,090
The two teams need to pin out the dolls in the pinball machine...


81
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,970
And throw it into the Full Line circle to complete the three-level competition.


82
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,270
The team that is the fastest to connect three laps into a line wins...


83
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,990
If the doll is thrown out of the circle, or thrown into the dominant Full Line circle.


84
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,190
will be deemed invalid.


85
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,070
The game version looks like this...


86
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,870
On behalf of the Namco boys, we will definitely win yours...


87
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,650
And we only need to fold three.


88
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,590
The whole bunch of little bugs are losing...


89
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,430
Wow, so weak, so weak.


90
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,770
The student union can help.


91
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,010
Our students will cancel your clubs.


92
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,490
You will never be able to catch the debt period again...


93
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,750
You can't buy our beard powder...


94
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,090
In short, the four of us will win you three.


95
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,230
Why the three of us?


96
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,810
Lost the throne.


97
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,070
Sorry, there's another one here, can't see it...


98
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,190
So let's get started right away.


99
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,510
Three pills in one foot for you to see...


100
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,730
Four's butts are awesome...


101
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,970
I want to kick him...


102
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:46,550
No please.


103
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,270
3,2,1,start.


104
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,430
Fold the middle one first, the middle one first...


105
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,750
just right


106
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,650
Is it powerful enough?


107
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,850
Enough, enough, enough.


108
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,350
Is it powerful enough?


109
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,690
hurry up


110
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,250
may not work may not work


111
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,950
You guys failed.


112
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,370
continue continue continue.


113
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,350
The whole whole.


114
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,890
You save, you save.


115
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,210
middle, middle, middle.


116
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,010

It’s elastic!


118
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,610
Has elasticity!


119
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,170
Are you wearing glasses?


120
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,950
No lenses?


121
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,250
Yes yes, we pretend to be sons...


122
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,230
The past, the right just...


123
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,870
Be careful not to get into their mouths, their mouths are hard...


124
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,830
OK, OK, OK, OK.


125
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,490
Let's go!


126
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,670
Don't get into it, oops, into the mouth...


127
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,490
We really have not succeeded, really have Ning Baoning, Ning give you.

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,570
You ignore him, ignore him...


133
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,510
He is a willow...


134
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,010

Why can't one of us get along?

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,050
Let's play together. Let's play together. Yeah, hey, hey, hey...

171
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:39,830

172
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,490
Come up and measure?


173
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,530
You guys go!


174
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,030
Don't pick him up either!


175
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,500
I wonder if your trick is air clamps!


176
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,880
Is that yours?


177
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,880
Pick him up!


178
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,300
Do you want to beat up some Yue Fei?


179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,020
Give it a try!


180
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
We shipped faster than it, we shipped faster than it...


181
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,140
Drink la drink la drink la drink la.


182
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,170
Hey how many jumps, Chu Chu, come together...


183
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,290
Ok, come on, come on...


184
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,030
Goubu, Zhu Zhuzai.


185
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,870
Sorry, I can't be sincere today...


186
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,690
He is so shitty.


187
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,650
Three', six', swim.


188
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,030
flawless, carrying, d alla.


189
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,490
Come on, come on, mine is okay, mine is okay, mine is okay...


190
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,510
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.


191
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,800
So nervous.


192
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,240
Hey Pang Jiali, you are the next owner.


193
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,940
Please call me by my full name, Mr. Pang Jialiying, okay?


194
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,160
3,2,1.


195
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,180
Pang Jialiying.


196
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
Just the first sound.


197
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:15,660
You guys are on hunger strike. It’s so funny. Beat them.


198
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:37,110
Forest collected 20 mosquitoes from my trade. You two, look at it. Hey, hey, hey, you can't catch people.


199
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,890
Yeah, you can't catch people...


200
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,810
Oops, whistle.


201
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,390
Oops, whistle.


202
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,730
No. That's not possible.


203
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,050
Win left.


204
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,550
Goal!


205
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,030
南櫫, 南櫫, 南櫫, 南櫫, 南櫫, 南櫫.


206
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,990
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok, it


207
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,290
's ok.


208
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,470
OK.


209
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,270
Try going down straight.


210
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,690
Wow, no inventor...


211
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,610
That's how the male sex boys won the student union...


212
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,470
easy.


213
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,830
Congratulations to them...


214
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,430
Cut你budget.


215
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,210
I have something to say, because our shape is spherical, so we will flick fast when we flake


216
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,390
d.


217
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,590
But I want to say, our cube is actually very difficult...


218
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,530
Astrologer, tell me.


219
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,850
Because of the hole, it needs a surface area is more.


220
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,330
What is called service scope?


221
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,370
Not a scammer.


222
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,170
Anyway, that's how we won it...


223
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,950
So we have won 1-0 now...


224
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,330
Never mind though, we give you more chances, we have three more mini-games to play.


225
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,210
You have a chance to catch up...


226
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,990
Enter the second game immediately.


227
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,730
Sticker photo challenge.


228
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,690
The contestants have to fight for entry in the sticker camera...


229
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,690
The presenter will use a different topic as a criterion each time...


230
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,930
Such as eyes, ears, mouth, nose.


231
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,290
As long as the contestant's part can be captured in the camera at the end, the team will gain 1 point.


232
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,050
After 3 rounds, the team with the highest score wins...


233
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,730
For a while, we will enter like this...


234
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:23,630
Jumi...so how do you get better?


235
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,690
In the underworld, he must be taking A-ju's for dumb position. Actually...


236
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,310
Is Chu Mi coming?


237
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,490
already found away


238
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,490
He is holding Chu Mi.


239
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,970
Three girls don't care about him...


240
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,530
And find something like that 30 places for me to do?


241
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,510
Will you lose to Zhu Mi?


242
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,510
You win him in everything except looks...


243
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,390
Right, I agree...


244
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,390
okay then.


245
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,450
You know astrology...


246
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,830
Do you think we were the first to win or lose?


247
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,170
win.


248
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,690
You took advantage of it so quickly, have you taken advantage of it?


249
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,590
Why are you angry with me?


250
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,990
Dewei?


251
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,710
ok us


252
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,510
You got it.


253
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,090
Do you have to be careful?


254
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,650
over things


255
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,610
Was it stolen? Was it beaten?


256
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,710
Not only?


257
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,190
Let's buy something?


258
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,130
Dedicated to Long Island?


259
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,630
Dead, dead, dead!


260
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,210
Super nice.


261
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:06,930
Dead, dead.


262
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,810
Just now I thought I was in the shot...


263
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,630
The first situation was so confusing.


264
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,270
There will be about 5-6 hands arriving, and the mark will be on the back.


265
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,270
The first hand, bang!


266
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,530
Then he dialed it away, then the second hand, then the glasses were gone, and then you can


267
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,170
The third and fourth, finally got pulled like this.


268
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,690
I saw him without his glasses, because I saw, I saw your eye, looking up like that.


269
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,110
Tongtong, why are you crying?


270
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,210
Why are you crying?


271
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,050
I want to touch there first, can I catch which one it is?


272
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,730
I may have a part, you guys do, can you.


273
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,630
I should have a share.


274
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,570
Wow!


275
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,650
Hey, hey, hey.


276
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,430
I don't think the mistress has caught all of her eyes.


277
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,390
But yes, they have a line, he if...


278
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,450
Wait, wow, this...actually...it's crazy just for this hand,


279
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,710
You have white hair.


280
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,070
Actually, I felt a little bit of mosquito carrot just now.


281
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,570
Save you, save you want to come.


282
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,110
This force of his, wow, you see, is very strong.


283
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,250
I don't have many eyes that are all red. Did I get beaten?


284
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,550
I am already without glasses in this position.


285
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,950
Actually, he really... almost had an eye.


286
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,970
If you pull up a little higher, I'll be in the frame.


287
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,010
I think Mistress this her a little worse.


288
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,350
He didn't, where, he didn't have a single eye.


289
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,970
Listen to me, because my eyes are really relatively small, actually into the sun in this eye.


290
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,670
No, no, but you... your face is negatively curled, really.


291
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,230
Your carrots are taller.


292
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,210
What's the point of fighting and frightening each other?


293
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,230
It's time to make a shop, it's time to make a shop.


294
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,710
I'm sorry, brother.


295
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,590
Like those BB pictures in superstar waves.


296
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,350
These tangerines are really out of the question.


297
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,090
I have another strategy, this time this is to say that fat mosquitoes dominate the position day and night first.


298
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,690
If the fat mosquito is let go, the three of us will pick it up like this underneath.


299
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,310
I want you to quickly occupy the front position.


300
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,890
Look or not, Erzai, Go!


301
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,640
The Arts Bureau is over, wow, Chairman Chu is in a mess.


302
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Yes, it’s a great match.


303
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,680
The fish is so stupid. How can I be the chairman?


304
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,020
What strategies did you have, you guys?


305
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,180
Just now, I was thinking of getting a broken shirt and hitting you alone.


306
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,420
Wow, your friend, the line is here.


307
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,440
Hit until I realize, can not throw away.


308
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,160
So I donate from the back back to the front.


309
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,680
Our strategy is very simple.


310
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,700
I was thinking that the fat mosquitoes rushed over, you would need three or four people to get away.


311
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,480
Our three sons came up on top of the people patrol below.


312
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,820
Why is it slow to enter?


313
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,600
There is no space left.


314
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,300
You can actually stretch with me, I'm so dumb.


315
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,820
Then they kept choosing left, choosing a right ear so he looked and turned and went to the left ear.


316
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,600
Pick again.


317
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,420
Yes, I said why is his ear still there?


318
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,700
Because I'm clearly driving on the left side.


319
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,060
Because there are two of each.


320
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,240
Come on, come on, and choose photos, and take photos.


321
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,920
Yes, yes.


322
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,480
Hello!


323
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,600
Wow!


324
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,780
Birth appearance?


325
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,080
What a handsome guy, G-5.


326
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,500
He is really handsome.


327
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,560
We win.


328
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,820
But my mouth is filled with tears?


329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,260
You brushed it into his ear hole?


330
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,560
Your finger is... Mia?


331
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,640
Very harsh, all of them.


332
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,760
See the nail, found it, which red nail, is it you?


333
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:52,980
you.


334
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
There is evidence.


335
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,080
Wait a minute, and this one, you stir your hair again, look, sunburned hair,


336
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,640
My hair is exposed to the sun, and my hair is exposed to mosquitoes. I want to ask, my hair is exposed to the sun, and my hair is exposed to mosquitoes.


337
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,820
The skin is already, I know my mouth will be so up, because it was pulled, I choose him down


338
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,760
Come on, if no one pulls, my land will be stoned together.


339
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,120
Is there any stone in your land, right?


340
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,320
I just had stones to girls crying, do not know where to talk, three.


341
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,180
Ok, so that means this game, one to one.


342
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,160
So that means we have to get to the third set, the tiebreaker.


343
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,500
OK.


344
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,980
Get ready, the third game, the deciding game!


345
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,320
GO!


346
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Okay, three girls don't get angry with their hands, then they use their hands, I use... their feet,


347
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,460
It's easy to stand up to it.


348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,020
I sprinkle my mouth wide and he doesn't dare to insert your hand and stick it out... stir


349
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:46,220
Hair, 3 2 1 just just just just just just just just just just


350
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,500
Right just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just


351
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,300
Right just now I want to eat good.


352
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,500
Hey, working on it guys.


353
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,000
You have to let Poki walk out.


354
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,440
You...you grab the left first the day before yesterday, and you grab the left first the day before yesterday.


355
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,390
The film is over, the film is over, the film is over.


356
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,230
Wow, some saliva, we got there!


357
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,030
I want to ask one thing, why did it become like this?


358
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,590
Wow!


359
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,310
When did you buy it, the rotten shirt?


360
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,110
Are you buying it?


361
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,390
You can get it as soon as you enter!


362
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,530
Are there any black and yellow ones?


363
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,650
Because my bridge is one fast, three two one ...


364
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,210
The grains went down, and the grains fell away.


365
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,950
I wonder why your hands are placed like this, so strange?


366
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,710
Because someone licked our hands!


367
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,710
I said really...I said that, because they love to cover us like that for six months,


368
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,930
Our trick is to ignore anything, just wipe big into your mouth and...


369
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,590
It means they really ignore me, they keep hitting me...


370
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,670
Wow, so disgusting!


371
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,790
He also hit the right topic this time, it's you!


372
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,730
I was the one who licked that hand.


373
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,550
I don't know one either, I ignore it...


374
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,210
Licking for a long time, are you sticking into my hand?


375
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,710
Yes, these candies are being eaten somewhere, it turns out I don't know why I clicked, took my hand back into


376
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:07,750
...


377
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,130
I can eat sugar, I can eat sugar.


378
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,410
Do you know the relationship between you and me?


379
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,510
I can eat some sugar, it's sweet.


380
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,710
I don't know where it is.


381
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,270
So why is it my hand?


382
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,360
Wow!


383
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
We finished filming!


384
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,540
Wow!


385
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,040
With some saliva we left!


386
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,540
Then what did Ah Bing say in it?


387
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,300
I said my whole hand was covered with Brother J's saliva!


388
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,480
No, what you said at the beginning was...


389
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,940
My whole mouth is filled with Brother J's saliva!


390
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,180
The whole mouth is filled with Brother J's saliva!


391
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,840
ha!


392
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,560
嗱!


393
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
They beat Kellen.


394
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,740
is that so


395
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,980
Small debate on the spot: Should middle school students hit Kellen?


396
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,060
It shouldn't be, I just said it wrong everyone...


397
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,160
Is there really any?


398
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,540
I don't stop.


399
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,240
Immediately, when are you willing to wipe your hands?


400
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,840
I really want to know if I made it...


401
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,960
Yes.


402
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,700
My tongue is so out...


403
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,680
The tongue is tied in the shape of a heart.


404
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,240
Tong Tong forgot about her new tongue...


405
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,120
Did I have, I was beaten...


406
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,540
Hit him, he's screaming...


407
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,520
This tongue should be responsive.


408
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,240
Hey, look clearly.


409
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,800
Li Ying's.


410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
The profit shouldn't be that high...


411
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,780
Is this plan beneficial?


412
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,480
Even who


413
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,020
Advantageous location.


414
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,840
Because the eight of us couldn't reach a consensus in the end...


415
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,040
We decided to get the staff outside the venue to help us see...


416
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
They are convinced that Leigh.


417
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,820
Only tie one tongue.


418
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,580
Just don't know whose tongue...


419
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,160
But luckily, we have installed a CCTV inside...


420
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,080
So we now go to the video right away and we can know who...


421
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,340
Benefit.


422
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,600
Benefit.


423
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,120
Benefit.


424
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,700
Benefit.


425
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,200
The benefits are below.


426
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,820
yes i am


427
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,300
There are so high over there...


428
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,420
You guys won the game, lost the wind.


429
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,020
But you lose the game, lose the honesty.


430
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,160
You guys lost girls.


431
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,660
All you get is our saliva.


432
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,540
So this game was won by our boys' school boys...


433
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,600
Boys in a boys' school.


434
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
although we


435
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,700
Maybe lost some games...


436
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,180
But I was playing with three girls...


437
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,820
we are all


438
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,360
You were playing with three girls, four boys...


439
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm so happy.


440
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
Enter the next game immediately.


441
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,540
Top cup battle.


442
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,500
Each team sends two members at a time.


443
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
Everyone holds a plastic cup on their head.


444
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Players have to try to drop the plastic cup of the opposing team...


445
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
While keeping your own plastic cup from falling...


446
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,160
The team that ended up holding the plastic cup on the field.


447
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,300
Win for it.


448
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,800
There's no way, the strongest of the other party must be the pig's mic...


449
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,500
Both have strong athletic ability.


450
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,580
And the height is yours to fight against.


451
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,920
Then you are very advantageous...


452
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,900
people can't see you


453
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,920
Send him up first...


454
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,480
I want to hit John.


455
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,460
Most importantly no expression.


456
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,220
Ha ha ha ha.


457
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,280
One is tall and one is short.


458
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,300
withstand.


459
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,880
to scare him


460
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,520
Follow me and raise your hands behind you.


461
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,340
You try it out.


462
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,400
He's afraid of his uncle...


463
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,780
so fight.


464
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,060
Will make up for it later.


465
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,760
done.


466
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,580
no good thing


467
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,420
好啊。


468
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:07,980
saved


469
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,560
can you guys jump up


470
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,340
You jump up and fight like that...


471
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,580
Jump up I don't think hard brother...


472
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,520
Baby I'll try to jump up now...


473
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,140
Try jumping.


474
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,000
One trick to go long.


475
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,360
ah.


476
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:15,760
Wow.


477
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,820
We now soldiers try to use a trick...


478
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,600
Hold a cup first.


479
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,460
Don't be seen by the opposite side...


480
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,120
Block, block, block.


481
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,800
Ha ha ha ha.


482
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,400
Turn around and see...


483
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,320
By the way we have to fight... and bow our heads...


484
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,720
So exciting.


485
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,920
Go in and actually.


486
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,840
Put the food in with a whip.


487
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,900
i have to


488
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,860
It's the brother in the ear...


489
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,020
this is our


490
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,320
Big chicken.


491
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,760
And we can make it longer.


492
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,680
Let's get a Gel.


493
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,640
Then we can press the camp.


494
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,440
You have to say that we are really good students...


495
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,200
We are just Nerds.


496
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,700
We bad.


497
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,820
We Gel head.


498
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,280
we are not Lut


499
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,540
we are not Lut


500
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,380
So you look over.


501
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,380
Hey, take a look first.


502
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,820
you don't have to


503
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,260
Everyone is so tight...


504
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,260
I hear your strategy.


505
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,380
What did they say?


506
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,200
I don't know.


507
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,540
Heard it.


508
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,680
I heard it.


509
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,920
What a waste.


510
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,320
The elites on both sides of you have stood up...


511
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,360
hey lost


512
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:11,800
lost.


513
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,340
lost.


514
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,540
We need so Plan A first.


515
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:13,760
OK?


516
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,240
good.


517
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,560
hey listen to me


518
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,720
Be prepared.


519
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,440
3 2 1.


520
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:21,980
start.


521
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,080
I suspect we hit badly...


522
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,660
We crashed...


523
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,180
Ah Tongtong.


524
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,820
The hero saw Tongtong.


525
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,160
Fat mosquito.


526
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,320
Go.


527
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:29,860
Go.


528
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
Come over quickly...


529
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,260
Fat mosquito.


530
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,120
Let's disperse Miss...


531
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,020
Tony.


532
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Blue shrimp boys.


533
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,360
Blue shrimp boys.


534
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,980
Why is the head so cheap?


535
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
You think we are vegetarians...


536
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,020
Why is the head so cheap?


537
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,360
none.


538
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,500
nothing


539
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,780
It's a bird's nest.


540
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,540
I’ll touch my head quickly today decía temmeuchg


541
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,560
Andrew.


542
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
great.


543
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,740
Our blue shrimp boys took down the first battle...


544
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,400
Come the second round.


545
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,780
Nanhe girls sent Golden King Naixing Xian to take photos.


546
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,240
Who is a girl? May I ask?


547
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,620
and the Apipe Orchestra.


548
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,300
You guys are not the strongest, we have always been strong.


549
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,820
Oh sorry, yes, you guys are the strongest.


550
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,660
I hit the left second force.


551
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,260
I suspect Fan Coffin opposite.


552
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,380
Why doesn't your head fall so tilted?


553
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,840
But he put it on his head too... I suspect he used glue.


554
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,660
His head shape is like this.


555
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,460
It's horizontal!


556
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,320
Yes, you are spicy!


557
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,380
Shit glue?


558
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,160
You really use a plugin right this?


559
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,240
That Nagasaki guy just over there, he locked the plate tightly with that electric method of his.


560
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,940
That’s it, you’re dead material Chao Lao.


561
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,100
Get ready, 3, 2, 1, start!


562
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,300
Listen to me.


563
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,300
Let's not play by ourselves, can we live?


564
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,440
That's how we look besides the collision?


565
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,060
Li Ying, what are you doing, Li Ying?


566
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,860
Hey, spread some, spread some!


567
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,580
Diffuse d is left and right, left and right clamp attack!


568
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,300
Catch me!


569
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,580
Yeah!


570
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,660
Ten times the buckle!


571
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,960
I'm stuck with him, I'm stuck with him!


572
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,660
stick!


573
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,220
stick!


574
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:10,940
stick!


575
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,400
Oops, lost!


576
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,660
The whole cup was taken!


577
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,300
You did a great job!


578
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,260
Well done, our strategy worked!


579
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,180
Student Union is really sorry, our boys' school boys won again.


580
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,060
I have to be sorry.


581
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,320
That battle was actually quite good, because, as soon as I saw the soldier's expression from the beginning,


582
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,180
That look full of confidence to fall into this abyss.


583
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,520
He thought he won hard.


584
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,300
He will never be happy again.


585
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,300
Wow, I got a lot just now.


586
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,600
what do you get


587
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,140
He was intertwined with me just now.


588
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,680
Yes, really!


589
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,620
Just now, oops, he stuck followed by ten fingers clasped, he didn't die to let go.


590
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,760
Yes, he hit me with one hand.


591
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,560
Play till the end!


592
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,260
Play till the end!


593
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,260
Although I won’t argue with my teammates...


594
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,760
You are not good, I think you.


595
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,340
No, strategy, right?


596
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,900
Which hand are you using to clasp his fingers tightly?


597
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,320
He hit this hand of mine!


598
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,540
Dan Jie is happy.


599
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,600
Since that's the case, let's move on to the next game and win us one more round.


600
00:22:59,700 --> 00:22:59,820
good?


601
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,060
good!


602
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,440
OK!


603
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,420
OK, let’s go to the next game immediately!


604
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,100
Wow!


605
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,480
Qi Zhanqiu PLUS Balance Challenge Each team sends two people to compete in Qi Zhanqiu duel.


606
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Balance challenge.


607
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,460
Participants in the balance challenge will need to bite into a snow stick with their mouths, and a coloring will be placed on it.


608
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,460
If the contestant who performs the air show successfully scores a goal, he or she can add a color to the opposite team.


609
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,820
When the color boy falls, the contestant will be eliminated.


610
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,360
When all participants who performed the Balance Challenge are eliminated, the game ends and the winning team gets


611
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,700
1 point.


612
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,640
Note that only the red large air balloons will be considered valid first, and other small air balloons will be considered interference.


613
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,380
Instant goals are not counted.


614
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,220
Wow!


615
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,400
Wow!


616
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,780
Lots of cams this time.


617
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,720
That’s right!


618
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,000
On to the last game, which is this...


619
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,260
Air Ball Balancing Contest!


620
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,220
That’s right!


621
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,780
Another name for this is they play us suffer!


622
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,060
OK!


623
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,920
Come on!


624
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,440
Two brothers!


625
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,100
Come on!


626
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,040
I haven’t played enough to live!


627
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,660
What?


628
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:51,960
Why?


629
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,180
My cover is on his side!


630
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,740
Your brothers just gave it to us!


631
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:54,760
What?


632
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,700
You gave it to others yourself?


633
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,280
Because just called us, you guys try to see if you can fly to the other side one!


634
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,160
That's it just now, flying like this...


635
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,160
Have they all been tricked?


636
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,080
We don't have one now!


637
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,420
You look at our faces, do we find it interesting?


638
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,120
Yes!


639
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,660
I think there is!


640
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,460
You try to stand in our place, it's easy to hold things!


641
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,360
So we're the ones with the best teeth on this side, Tiger Talk!


642
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,120
The Chess Society of Export Technique!

I'm the singer-songwriter Peng Ka-lai-ying!


645
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,320
Hey, let’s sing back now!


646
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,800
It turned out that he left voluntarily!


647
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,860
Hey, what a different song!

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,880
Heavy!


649
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,920
The war is about to break out!


650
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,560
Hey, stop it for me!


651
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,800

The lover's pants have lost color!


669
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,300
The lover's pants have been burned!


670
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,640
So it's just hair makeup!

Now they haven't signed a petition here saying they want to add color!


674
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,140
Pine sun!

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,740
You are a little scared!


676

You have a little tilt downward!


677

Wow!


704
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,380
You hit it!


705
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,800
What a taste!


706
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,840
Hold on!


707
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,320
Hold on!

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,740

I asked Sinnie, where did she appreciate us the most on the way back?


715
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,160
Sinnie, I don’t want you to see me as a friend?


716
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,720
What did you admire most about me?


717
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,880

718
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,480
Don't think about it!


726
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,320
Don't think about it!


727
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,760
Oh shit!


728
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,380

He doesn't recognize you!


754
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,540

00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,560
so tired!


756
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,720
It doesn't matter!


757
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,460
You are very strong!


758
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,020
Seven pills!


759
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,340
We finally win!


760
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,480
Hard work!


761
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,860
It can't be chewed, but the throat is still still!


762
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,800
oh really?


763
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,160
Tie!


764
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,360
Already in the throat at the beginning!


765
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,780
As soon as it’s tied, it’s a bust!


766
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,780
Good luck!


767
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,700
Then I want to cut!


768
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,020
Then cut can not, slowly spray back the tongue out!


769
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
That means there's still a whole pocket of saliva in there!


770
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,000
Then can't get out the tongue, and can't swallow!


771
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm sorry!


772
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The two with the worst concentration in my land!


773
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,080

Let the people do their best!


777

The strength of our gang defeated you!


778
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,980
It’s hard to hold back your laughter!


779
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,080
It's hard to hear whether there is anything to say!


780
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,260
Wow!


781
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,980

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,280

787
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,720
Our land immediately enters the scoring ring battle!


788
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,180
Tie!


789
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,580
Let’s play the game!


790
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,360
Big win!


791
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,380
Is it a microphone this time?


792
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,160
Our land has won a great victory!


793
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,600
Then you're just playing!


794
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,360
Go catch chess!


795
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,120
Dropped into the park!


796
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:57,840
King of Riders!


797
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,740
Just catch...King Li!


798
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,740
King of Riders!


799
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,680
Click on the student union?


800
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,700
Are you having fun?


801
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,440
Aren't you happy to lose?


802
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:03,980
Are you having fun?


803
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,720
I am so passionate!


804

We are all doing our best!


805
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,560
My land is doing well!


806
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,700
Our country will have no regrets!


807
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,620
Are you a college student?


808
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:08,800
