00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,260
Ah J, you don't have to be afraid this time, no one will talk to you.


14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,480
You can rely on yourself and win it back...


15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,840
Everyone depends on their own...


16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,760
Let's introduce it first, shall we?


17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,660
Who are you?


18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,340
Hello everyone, my name is Aladdin.


19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,320
You are a horse!


20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,280
Awa.

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,320
No, but I didn't know the OV was a little like Apo, I was interested.


22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,400
I wear vinyl...


23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,180
Prince.

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,720
Prince?


25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,060
Wrong in the streets...


26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,020
It is sweet and juicy.


27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,220
I am the butterfly of 144P who can't help it.


28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,360
I can't help but beat you up.


29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,380

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,580
I thought you were the Green Warrior Tim.


33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,380
I can't help it.


34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,140
I am Ninja Rentaro.


35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,920
are you a newbie or who


36
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,140
You really have the same 100% courage as the theme song...


37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:35,780
Wow!


38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,600
So pretty.


39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,860
introduce.


40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,840
Hello everyone, I’m Bonnie’s grandma, Dali.


41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,620
I am the same sister.


42
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,640
Sister!


43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,420
Sister!


44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I've even stunk you.


45
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,620
Have you ever stinked me?


46
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,320
Hi everyone, I love nature...


47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,560
The People's Congress is deploying troops.


48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,580
Young people, how do you dress up like that?


49
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,520
Is it my responsibility?


50
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,260
It’s a bear!


51
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,500
Give you a like!


52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,580
Have you never seen Ji Guang, a real man?


53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So domineering.


54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,220
Ok, let’s get into the first game right away.


55
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,020
The first rule of the game.


56
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,740
123 It's Party Time.


57
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,000
The gameplay is similar to 123 Traffic Light.


58
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,920
The host speaks the topic and slogan with his back to the participants.


59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Participants need to make the corresponding action at the end of the slogan...


60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,620
1 point is awarded for successfully crossing the finish line.


61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,900
Okay, read the rules of the game...


62
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,920
This game tests everyone's reaction and flexibility...


63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,780
So flexible.


64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,160
first question.


65
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,160
Put on your most MK posture...


66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,660
123 It's Party Time.


67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,880
A J.


68
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,260
OK.


69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,580
OK.


70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,720
What’s the solution?


71
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,780
Do you think you are so bad?


72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,760
I have never seen a blessed disciple when I was pregnant with the sea court...


73
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,900
Like come, like come.


74
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,660
To find him?


75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,280
ah.


76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Oh, that’s right.


77
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,500
OK.


78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
This MOOK is the best.


79
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,140
Eat two.


80
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,360
I was picking up photos in the toilet...


81
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,240
Those sticker photos those machines...


82
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay, second question.


83
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,900
Classic character action.


84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,380
123 It's Party Time.


85
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,300
OK.


86
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,420
This is over.


87
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:11,980
Is it Mia?


88
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,440
bluebird.


89
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:12,900
Soski.


90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,340
Red pig.


91
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,900
No


92
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,520
What is it?


93
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,400
Aaron in this street fighter...


94
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Wave fist.


95
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,720
Sigh.


96
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,020
OK.


97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:19,960
Master.


98
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,100
Master.


99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
I want to say, confront you.


100
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,040
It doesn't look like a mirror...


101
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,320
Tutu will find out.


102
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,880
Why do I suddenly notice my body?


103
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,260
That's right, you guys wait for you more...


104
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,040
Question three.


105
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:33,940
animal.


106
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
123 It's Party Time.


107
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,660
I think two to eliminate...


108
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,140
One is for you and the other is for Jay.


109
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,760
what are you


110
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,320
frog.


111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,680
My name is Baron.


112
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,340
Playing with a dog will bring you back the peach.


113
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,940
So what are these two eliminated?


114
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,100
No, what?


115
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,300
But he seems to.


116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,600
OK.


117
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,360
what are you


118
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm a dinosaur of plastic...


119
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
you two are the same


120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,900
are you again


121
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,360
I don't have a plastic dinosaur...


122
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,140
What are you talking about?


123
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,160
Wood-gnawing dinosaur.


124
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,100
The dinosaur's hands were like this, but he was accidentally eating grass so he called November.


125
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,260
Yeah yeah yeah!


126
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,340
He said grass-eating dragons, we are obviously tyrannosaurs...


127
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,300
We are dinosaurs like hands...


128
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,820
Herbivorous dragon's hands must not be like this...


129
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,540
It's so obvious, it's so easy to eat.


130
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,440
What are you talking about?


131
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,900
What do you think it is?


132
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,000
Will there be some little Velociraptors in those groups of ours?


133
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,280
Are there so many dragons?


134
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,040
It's all dragons...


135
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,420
I don't know if I'm right, we have to know what you mean...


136
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,640
Question 4, the most bold posture, 1 2 3.


137
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
Very skateboarding right that said.


138
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,520
Let me explain first.


139
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,400
This is John.


140
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,320
Thank you, but you're back, you're in charge...


141
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,520
You stop!


142
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
What kind of material is this?


143
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
What do you think it is?


144
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,460
Where do you want to hit me?


145
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,240
We are not allowed to collect and mop the floor.


146
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,020
i won


147
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,720
You won, ok.


148
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,240
Well, the poses that beauty pageants would pose nowadays, the second, third, fighting


149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,480
time!


150
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,760
we crossed


151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, you can handle it.


152
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,180
You didn't participate in that beauty pageant?


153
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,240
no, not high enough...


154
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,780
And you?


155
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,500
What's the matter?


156
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,540
I'm staying hi, with your hi, hello, hi.


157
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
Because many fans need two hands to lift.


158
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,220
Well, two of us have completely crossed this line this time. If you give it to you, Ah Fu...


159
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,400
Let’s talk about our character names.


160
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,320
forgot


161
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:15,960
A Robin Hood.


162
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,040
I am a true man.


163
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,980
That is, an honest man is like half a foot of an iceberg.


164
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,280
Okay, it’s the second round, are you ready?


165
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,560
Ready.


166
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,520
Question 1, poses of prostitutes taking pictures, 1, 2, 3, fighting


167
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:30,700
time!


168
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,940
very fashionable


169
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,180
Because I have long legs, standing like this, people's legs will grow more.


170
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Such a hand is?


171
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,720
beautiful


172
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,920
And you?


173
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,900
I used to see prostitutes looking like this in Sai Yeung Chai South Street.


174
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,560
This system...


175
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,900
lotus fish


176
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,500
I see you usually take pictures like this...


177
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,220
no it's not


178
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,540
Okay, second question, the classic moves that have appeared in small potatoes, 1, 2, 3, fighting


179
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,680
time!


180
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,900
What's the relationship?


181
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,900
Get angry.


182
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,920
The irritation is so high right?


183
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,400
And Ah Bing's height is almost the same.


184
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,520
what is this


185
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,020
This is the real one?


186
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,620
My lord!


187
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,320
Each type, each type of focus?


188
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,220
You did a great job, you look like the original.


189
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,340
You did it just like the original.


190
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,960
almost leave


191
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,820
This system...


192
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,500
Beat the whip!


193
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
Two shots were fired successfully.


194
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,100
It's classic...


195
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
I just thought of one more, this one...


196
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
It's compensation, it's compensation...


197
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,720
to compensate


198
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,820
Damn it, I have to pay for it, I have to pay for it...


199
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,260
Wrong, your legs should be straight.


200
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,620
What do you want to move?


201
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm teaching him...


202
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Give you one chance, don't do it next time...


203
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,220
Thank you very much.


204
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,820
What kind of material is this?


205
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,440
Your hands are so tired.


206
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,340
Oh yeah.


207
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,500
OK.


208
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,660
My hands are tired.


209
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,900
The hands are very high, so that...


210
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,120
My hands are tired...


211
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,860
Question 3: Actions to attract the opposite sex.


212
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,700
1,2,3.


213
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,440
It's fighting time.


214
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,660
Jay, what would make you think this pose is attractive to the opposite sex?


215
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,840
People look to high places.


216
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,500
Looking at the sky, then you count the muscles, can you see that I'm squeezing...


217
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,100
To top it out like this...


218
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,140
That is to say, it proves that a good waist and kidneys are a good man.


219
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,540
First?


220
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,460
How do you think I attract heterosexuals?


221
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Because of this, good wind dance is like this.


222
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,500
I think dancing is very attractive when it is...


223
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,420
I don't think you are very attractive to the opposite sex.


224
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,100
So kick him in the back...


225
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,700
No, his face is already...


226
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,620
Yes you did not make any movements did you?


227
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,340
He didn't make any movement.


228
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,020
Do you know why you don't have to do anything?


229
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,900
OK.


230
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm presenting that the most important thing to attract the opposite sex is confidence, you have to exude that confident F


231
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,640
ive.


232
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,720
Are you ordering again?


233
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,880
I think he should kick in the back...


234
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,860
I find it very attractive.


235
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,040
Originally thought it was a little lower so you could look like very rich.


236
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,940
But I think it seems a little higher to show a healthy god for you to see seems better.


237
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,660
The god of health.


238
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
The god of health.


239
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,320
My mom met my dad after posing...


240
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,240
Your father came over there and became my wife.


241
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,220
I think people who have a heart are the most attractive to the opposite sex...


242
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
Movement barrel.


243
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,980
Some people say I'm in love, can you talk to me for a while?


244
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,400
It's usually a man's trick.


245
00:07:59,680 --> 00:07:59,700
oh.


246
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,700
Have you ever done this?


247
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,020
I've never done it.


248
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,180
The subject of this action is to attract the same sex.


249
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,900
I find that I have some misunderstandings about this question: It must be human.


250
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Because I see stars are so attracted to the opposite sex...


251
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,960
Go to the back.


252
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,380
Okay you.


253
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,920
Death.


254
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay, next one.


255
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,600
The pose is scary...


256
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,300
1,2,3.


257
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,740
It's my turn.


258
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,220
Can you walk back to Chai Wan Kok Street...


259
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,200
I am wild.


260
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,740
G-man, do you think this action system is so scary? Man, do you think it is...


261
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,080
why?


262
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,260
I think it's kind of weird...


263
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,060
What a surprise.


264
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,820
Good surprise.


265
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,700
what is this


266
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
I've tried this before.


267
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,680
This scared Tong Tong into flying.


268
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,560
It scared him to go to Shenzhen...


269
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,460
you kill us


270
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,080
Okay so this Round this is Ah B ing. And Ah J this is over the line one


271
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,320
point.


272
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,200
good.


273
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
Go to the next game immediately.


274
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,520
Action Solitaire.


275
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,900
The first participant performs an action first.


276
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,680
The second participant will follow suit.


277
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,740
Then add a new action...


278
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,820
And so on.


279
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,780
If you fail to connect or do the wrong move, you will be eliminated.


280
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,760
Two people are eliminated in each round.


281
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Participants who are not eliminated will get one point.


282
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,100
Well here comes a new game.


283
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,620
It will test your body movements and memory...


284
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
Confidence this time?


285
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,280
Of course there is.


286
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,540
The highest Q power.


287
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,000
Look at Brother J doing so tightly.


288
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,340
I also know that you are a physical actor.


289
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,680
I think Ah J has improved a lot lately.


290
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,540
Because we are going to rehearsal like this Milo is playing the drums...


291
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
Milo is tight.


292
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,460
I'll see what...


293
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960
So 4 minutes 2 times.


294
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,420
This one Drop the beat.


295
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,120
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 heads.


296
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,280
What a tease.


297
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,220
7 8 9 10 At most, tie my neck as a gift.


298
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,260
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 Two mouthfuls.


299
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,080
6 7 8 3 4 3 4 It's a healthy exercise...


300
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,520
1 2 3 4 This looks okay.


301
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,000
Some money rich...


302
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,520
7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 Give your feet back...


303
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,420

304
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,740
so hard.


305
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,180
Dead.


306
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,900
Every one.


307
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,380
Why is he twisted so softly...


308
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,720
3 2 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1


309
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,520

310
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,840
Isn't it super hard to remember?


311
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm starting to lose track of it.


312
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,420
1 2 3 4 Sun is dead.


313
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:36,680
iscal.


314
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,080
Wow


315
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,700
I'm so noisy about your movements...


316
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,340
1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8,9,10...


317
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,400
So pretty!


318
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,160
Everyone is nervous...


319
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,100
Wow!


320
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:21,760
Wow!


321
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,040

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,500

328
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,000

Whoa, whoa, whoa, every soul!

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,470
Wow!


364
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,790
We didn't get to... suffered!


365
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,330
Damn it!


366
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,070
So surprised!


367
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,110

Akko!


370
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,550
You lose!


371
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,570
Rintaro is smart enough!


372
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,410
Rintaro was Rintaro from the beginning to the end!


373
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,690
It's so noisy!


374
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,670
Throw the machine!


375
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,250
Throw the machine!


376
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,850
Rintaro!


377
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,530
Wipe your hat on!


378
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,410
Your hands are not like that, Brother Fu!


379
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,270
What is it?


380
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,410
Your hands are like that!


381
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,850
Wow!


382
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,470
It's so difficult!


383
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,010
Really don't be!


384
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,050
It's so difficult that I'm crazy!


385
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,110
Sound is helpful!


386
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,230
Buddha's Palm!


387
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,390
Wow!


388
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,910
His Tathagata Palm KOed two of them!


389
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,050
very strong


390
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,190
So cool!


391
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,330
So cool!


392
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,370
So we eliminated Ali Ying and Ah Bing this round!


393
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,070
It’s so difficult for everyone!


394
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,790
What a difficult game!


395
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:03,750
It's really difficult!


396
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:06,950
OK!


397
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,090
It’s a new round!


398
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,230
I hope you do some harder and more performative moves!


399
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,610
We just looked down on our actions!


400
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:15,950
Solve the numbers head first?


401
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,670
So many actions!


402
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,490
At least step down by two!


403
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,650
Dancing master!


404
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,470
It’s time to dance high!


405
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,790
Why are they not much taller than me?


406
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,630
It's not that I'm much taller than you!


407
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,910
I call you the income and expenditure boss!


408
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,770
Don't mess with my party!


409
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,630
DJ!


410
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,710
Drop the beat!


411
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,750
Can't you hear what he doesn't have yet!


412
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,070
The same fake move!


413
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,410
Didn’t get it!


414
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,390
Wow, it’s so difficult!


415
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,810
It’s so hard to chase the wave!


416
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:50,810
OK!


417
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,330
Right, right, left, left, wow!


418
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,570
How good!


419
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,810
Cross front!


420
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,550
Wow, it’s so difficult!


421
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,950
This...Jay is so quick!


422
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,250
Twenty-character front!


423
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,950
Twenty-word front!


424
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,010
Twenty-word front!


425
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,530
Twenty-character front!


426
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,410
Very CUE, like Mr. Tang CUE.


427
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,530
No, no, it's not scary.


428
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,410
Yellow label, yellow label!


429
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,350
It turned out that this was difficult for him.


430
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,290
So hard to follow.


431
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,610
Wow, so difficult.


432
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,870
I won't lose.


433
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,390
Brother Ji, I am only 20 steps.


434
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,010
Not pretty I guess.


435
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,570
Nice, so pretty.


436
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,890
He finally went back to the real action right.


437
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,490
Twenty steps, twenty steps, twenty steps!


438
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,590
But his 20th step d, not two shoot one.


439
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,890
Wow, she's amazing.


440
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,230
Wow, she's amazing.


441
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:04,950
Wow, what?


442
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,750
I find that looking at your face is helpful.


443
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,630
Each action system has its own unique style.


444
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,710
How many pictures how to skip those?


445
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,230
Department, there are a few.


446
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,950
It's like an ink book.


447
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,770
You have to go on stage to perform before you have practiced dancing.


448
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,090
I dance well!


449
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,670
Twenty steps, twenty steps, twenty steps!


450
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,170
Six, seven...


451
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:28,830
Wow!


452
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,010
Side first.


453
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,490
Then We are We are.


454
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,350
We are We are.


455
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,610
We are We are We are.


456
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,170
Michael Jackson’s Finnish!


457
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,250
Wow, you talk to the chorus about Michael Jackson, you really provoke him now


458
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,630
True relationship.


459
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,090
Wow, so cute!


460
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,730
Strange, twenty steps!


461
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,010
Really a lot of legs.


462
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,870
who?


463
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,270
We are We are We are We are We


464
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:08,450
are.


465
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,050
So slow stuff!


466
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,050
Wow!


467
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,370
big


468
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,220
Come on, don't cry, don't cry!


469
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,780
Wow!


470
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,560
Is that the line?


471
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,160
What's the matter?


472
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,820
am i me first


473
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,120
Yes!


474
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,360
Yes!


475
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,040
Wow, please, at least yes.


476
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:33,940
Tie...


477
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,980
I...


478
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,540
puff?


479
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,120
laugh...


480
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,200
laugh...


481
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,880
You are so noisy!


482
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,860
D is just covering up the uneasiness, you understand?


483
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,380
Tie?


484
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,620
Face we all!


485
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,760
He has to get to his own...


486
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,960
It's me to his own...


487
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,680
Twenty character steps.


488
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,660
It's all 20-word steps...


489
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,860
he can do it


490
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,780
he can do it


491
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,620
So cool.


492
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,940
His clothes look good...


493
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,220
Do these.


494
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,700
middle


495
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,520
ah!


496
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,520
I know, Brother J.


497
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,520
I know you worked hard.


498
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,120
Come on, fat mosquito.


499
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,840
Come on, fat mosquito.


500
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,760
Come on, fat mosquito.


501
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,900
Come on, fat mosquito.


502
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Come on, fat mosquito.


503
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,840
Come on, fat mosquito.


504
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
Let's start sexy first.


505
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,040
Twenty character steps.


506
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,600
Is that so, Brother J, just now?


507
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,620
So difficult!


508
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,060
It's like a jelly...


509
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,190
Wow, became a scalp guy...


510
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,470
turned into a skin...


511
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:40,580
What a surprise.


512
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,800
Come on, you can...


513
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,910
Twenty character steps.


514
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,410
Six seven eight one two three four.


515
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,650
Five six seven eight one two three four.


516
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:57,790
You are a warning.


517
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,070
Five six seven eight one two three four.


518
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,430
So surprised.


519
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:20,230
Oh no


520
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Laugh.


521
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,580
Wow, what a surprise.


522
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,060
It’s really hard to make AJ Guo only use the original frame.


523
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,600
Ride the bend, ride the bend, ride the bend.


524
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,480
Side, side, side, side.


525
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,780
We are win, win, win, win.


526
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,820
Where are you, where are you...


527
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,320
indivual


528
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,060
Everyone has hidden their tricks...


529
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,120
I hope Jumai you can dance and don't get confused...


530
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,840
I have to call Regus...


531
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,720
This game is slowly evolving into a game of betting on dignity.


532
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,220
You see his face, these two people's faces, changed...


533
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,240
Fortunately I I bet, 80,000 millionaire I people take 8 thousand dollars and leave even if.


534
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,680
Really, it's a lot of things...


535
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,180
22...


536
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,780
22 high.


537
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,600
This is really good, this...


538
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Hey, you dance so well.


539
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,060
Yes, so surprised.


540
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,160
I hope it won't come...


541
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,240
How many?


542
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,300
The most beautiful.


543
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,440
1,2...


544
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,540
It turns out that wrapping seems to be...


545
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,520
undecided


546
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:27,840
not sure


547
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,400
no can not


548
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,660
But in GYM you will just dance strong and beautiful.


549
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,480
you can't lose


550
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,780
Talk about something slowly.


551
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,160
In groups of two, one of them needs to guide the other to say the specified pair by acting


552
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,300
white.


553
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,840
Successfully speaking the assigned dialogue, both can score...


554
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,580
Tie.


555
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,760
Okay, there's a new game.


556
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,200
This game tests your tacit understanding and turnover...


557
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,760
We didn't.


558
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,680
There is no turnaround, but we can tacitly agree because we are cousins...


559
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,100
Ok, that's the topic...


560
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,360
Let's see if you can say it...


561
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:06,920
good.


562
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,620
3,2,1,action.


563
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,880
Tell me something from your heart...


564
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,280
my thoughts


565
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm not upset.


566
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,560
I have something on my mind, I have something on my mind.


567
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,040
Tell you a secret than me...


568
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,640
You are so ugly.


569
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,440
Let me tell you that you know a secret better than I do.


570
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,540
I told you you are so ugly.


571
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,520
No, it's not a secret...


572
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Open secrets.


573
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,580
that cannot be concealed.


574
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,700
Let me tell you a secret you know better than me.


575
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,760
I know, I am a man.


576
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
Come, green and red box, continue .


577
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,200
but i really


578
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,620
hurry up


579
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm willing to risk my life.


580
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,180
Tell me your three feelings...


581
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,820
I'll attack you on the street.


582
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,780
What's the sentence?


583
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,480
Asked.


584
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,840
I don't dare to face it.


585
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,780
He thought to say so like...


586
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,060
OK.


587
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,900
Can the photographer cut some?


588
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,600
good...


589
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,860
Cut, cut, cut.


590
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,920
Galaxy Honey Cat talks better than me.


591
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,060
I see you listen better than me.


592
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,040
A great achievement.


593
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,060
why did i tell you


594
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,420
really this


595
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,220
Yes.


596
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,300
Yes.


597
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,040
I want to say really have to give me some applause...


598
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,460
Because I am a good match.


599
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,260
Yes, I'm so nervous.


600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,100
I really have to thank myself...


601
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,960
I gave this really well...


602
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,720
To put it bluntly, you are becoming not bad...


603
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,120
This time it's Ah Fai Bin versus Ah Mosquito...


604
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,960
Fat Bintou.


605
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,740
In fact, I have already...


606
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,800
Open the teeth.


607
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,480
I don't know why this...


608
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,520
First plate...


609
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,460
Wear a helmet, you idiot.


610
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,120
will you beat me


611
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Why are you so surprised?


612
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,080
How surprising is it to hit you?


613
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,580
You know my new guy...


614
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,460
I won't be so scared...


615
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,440
I was more energetic than I was talking about.


616
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,460
You look and see if you can pack it yourself.


617
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,780
So this is what Ah Fatty has to say...


618
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,080
OK.


619
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,640
3,2,1.


620
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,180
Action.


621
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,320
Fat boy.


622
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,880
I see you always looking at me in class...


623
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,920
Why?


624
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,480
because...


625
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,080
Because I only see you.


626
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
You are so disgusting...


627
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,820
Not that you are wrong that you are disgusting.


628
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,140
So you beat my father.


629
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,880
Hit me and do it.


630
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,520
Hello.


631
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,580
Fat boy.


632
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,080
Why do I... in the morning...


633
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,520
You bought me breakfast too?


634
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,020
You don't have enough to eat.


635
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,820
I'm not happy.


636
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,140
Hello.


637
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,220
You are so greasy.


638
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
I support him...


639
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,440
Achuan, you haven't been too long?


640
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,060
Because breakfast is for you.


641
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,600
Let's do the same thing...


642
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,680
I don't understand that...


643
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:19,860
I don't understand...


644
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:21,980
Yes.


645
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,680
continue.


646
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,960
I found a love letter in Locker before. Did you give it to me?


647
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,840
Absolutely.


648
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,640
because I love you.


649
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,300
no really good...


650
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,860
I really can't help it...


651
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,660
no really good...


652
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm not that COW...


653
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,120
I'm not that COW


654
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,980
Are you wearing a helmet...


655
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,920
I beat him to death...


656
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,040
I finally know why I want to be a construction worker...


657
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Let me think about me first...


658
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,980
a bit difficult


659
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,360
It's not important.


660
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,200
Let me receive anything...


661
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,500
I remember, I already received a love letter from you when I was in Form 1...


662
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
We are all in sixth grade now...


663
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,880
Thank you so much.


664
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
You will remember fondly what I wrote you.


665
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,560
Actually, Ah Bing asked this very well.


666
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,940
But the answer is so bad...


667
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,520
I got to that answer...


668
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,440
really...


669
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,440
I told you about it myself earlier.


670
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:56,800
Click, sister.


671
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,240
The fat intestines are so good that you can serve them right away.


672
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm focused on this game.


673
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
I can't focus on you...


674
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,880
Did you know that many people want to sit in your seat...


675
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,260
That means it's been so long from Form 1 to Form 6...


676
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,440
I know what you mean...


677
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,080
Actually, do you have anything to tell me...


678
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,720
I want you to be my girlfriend.


679
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,880
right


680
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,540
But I think some of the close ones are...


681
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,100
I think feelings have a fight now...


682
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,540
Haven't reached his position actually...


683
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,040
Okay.


684
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,060
stage.


685
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,980
Make me complicated.


686
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,160
It seems like you gave him a good tip...


687
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,400
oh really.


688
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,920
Okay.


689
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,080
Let him answer the last one...


690
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,460
OK.


691
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,700
OK.


692
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,200
come on


693
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,160
Send your hand first.


694
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,480
oh really?


695
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,060
Yes.


696
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,520
Send your hand first.


697
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:30,920
OK.


698
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,040
OK.


699
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,350
In fact, you think I'm a fan of ice?


700
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,350
Hey hey hey hey.


701
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,230
Tie, tie, tie.


702
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,450
Don't be like that.


703
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,710
Sorry.


704
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,310
It's me who gave me that feeling...


705
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:44,990
Okay.


706
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,350
To make up for it, I didn't want to poke you at it...


707
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,690
I let Ah Bing play the drums...


708
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,150
good.


709
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,490
Ah Bing.


710
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,130
The answer is.


711
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,910
Actually I've liked you for a long time...


712
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,510
hey this is the answer


713
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,130
this is the answer


714
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,290
The answer is really...


715
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:56,770
The answer is really...


716
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,550
Okay.


717
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,930
come this time


718
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,310
Li Ying and Chu Mi La...


719
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:03,730
Tie.


720
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,530
Have confidence.


721
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:04,910
have.


722
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,350
good.


723
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,690
This is the dialogue that Li Ying wants Chu Mi to say...


724
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,390
Wow.


725
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,750
Wow.


726
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,330
Wow.


727
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,490
okay.


728
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,130
I can speak well to everyone.


729
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,290
okay.


730
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,130
You are a bad person.


731
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,750
of two.


732
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,310
I think two


733
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,870
This is two.


734
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,470
Okay.


735
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:17,650
Prepare.


736
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,590
321.


737
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,010
Action.


738
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,410
Tell the truth.


739
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,250
Honestly who do I like to go out with...


740
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,530
Just go out with any man or woman...


741
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,250
Actually, I don't have to care about you...


742
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,670
Nice.


743
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,290
Who do you think I am?


744
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,290
What do you mean?


745
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,330
You know it yourself.


746
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,490
It's only justice for me to rob you of all your money, isn't it...


747
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,010
It's low to rob all your money...


748
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,690
why did you lie to me


749
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,610
I grabbed it in front of you...


750
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,150
You feel so stupid.


751
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,630
That would make me very unhappy...


752
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,230
Yes.


753
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,390
I just want you to be unhappy...


754
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,050
I was with you...


755
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,050
I even went out with your friend...


756
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:53,890
Hello.


757
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,270
give a


758
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,210
Why did you give me a cuckold?


759
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,350
We broke up.


760
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,110
No.


761
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,130
break up should be now...


762
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,050
What a weak person.


763
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,490
What a piece of trash.


764
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,350
Cheer up.


765
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,970
You are a bitch.


766
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:12,930
So exciting.


767
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,790
You can get rid of this woolen hat.


768
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,530
You are eligible for removal.


769
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,030
Don't be afraid of wearing it. The most important thing is to remove it quickly.


770
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,950
So exciting.


771
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,270
There is a chance that I will become a loser for you.


772
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,250
Or you bitch.


773
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,330
You're right.


774
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,410
why do you talk about bitches?


775
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,050
I only feel that Wumingbao is angry.


776
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,250
You bitch.


777
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,070
success.


778
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,770
success.


779
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,150
success.


780
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,110
really really


781
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,730
what a bitch


782
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,270
Li Ying, you are great as a bitch...


783
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,010
yes honey.


784
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,670
Make a play.


785
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,290
Make fun of everyone.


786
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,270
Li Ying, you are always right...


787
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,810
Yes.


788
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,450
so just right


789
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,650
I really don't know why that's right...


790
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,190
good.


791
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,350
Next group.


792
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,110
The next White House.


793
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,550
Okay.


794
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,570
Here comes a new group...


795
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,350
That's Ah J...


796
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,230
So just now Ah Bing couldn't get points...


797
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,830
So I sent Ah Bing to confront you.


798
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:58,650
I didn't get any points just yet...


799
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:58,890
Department La.


800
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,150
Although I've known you for ten years...


801
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,230
but no


802
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,290
That is, my feelings for Ah Bing...


803
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:02,690
I'm with you.


804
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,490
I did the same to you...


805
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,830
good.


806
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,870
What about Ah J.


807
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,310
This is the sentence for Ah Bing to say...


808
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,010
it doesn't make sense anymore...


809
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:10,910
So nervous.


810
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,790
It seems hard to say and it seems far away.


811
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,090
Then you might not have to talk...


812
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:14,970
oh really?


813
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,350
oh really?


814
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:16,970
Very much looking forward to it.


815
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,230
Prepare.


816
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:17,650
three.


817
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,350
two.


818
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:18,970
one.


819
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,530
Action.


820
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,510
don't walk around


821
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,930
Ah J, don't get any closer.


822
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,030
it's hard to do


823
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,670
Please come a little farther from me...


824
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,950
How am I stylish today?


825
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,090
Brother J, you are so handsome.


826
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,010
Brother J, can you be so cool?


827
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,230
Is it really that cool...


828
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:37,950
dumb.


829
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,870
Is he dumb?


830
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,330
Brother J, you are so strange.


831
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,390
Brother J...


832
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,590
Order it?


833
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,930
Order it?


834
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,470
I...


835
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,730
How stupid.


836
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,950
Brother J, aren't you feeling unwell?


837
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,150
Say it's not uncomfortable?


838
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,230
Brother J, you are a pervert.


839
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,710
Brother J, you are so wretched.


840
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,130
Neurosis.


841
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,630
Brother J, you are so bad.


842
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,370
Hello brother J...


843
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,110
Electric stalk.


844
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,170
It hurts so much.


845
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,190
It's really Shanghai all the time...


846
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,430
You are not heavy enough.


847
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,070
Hello brother J...


848
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:13,950
Quter.


849
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,050
There are some pianos...


850
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,850
There are some pianos...


851
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,810
Go away.


852
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,390
Actually, Ah Bing is miserable to some extent...


853
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,850
Say the words inside you...


854
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,590
I think...


855
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,010
I like you so much.


856
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,610
I like you so much.


857
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,650
What do you think?


858
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,650
I think...


859
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,590
I feel uncomfortable.


860
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,010
Are you feeling uncomfortable?


861
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,070
I feel uncomfortable.


862
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,430
what is it


863
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,250
it's over


864
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,150
OK, J.


865
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,290
What is that saying?


866
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,930
I feel like vomiting when I see you.


867
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,950
Do you ever feel this way?


868
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,610
I do not have it.


869
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,210
he didn't


870
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,710
Actually, I feel so awake.


871
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,630
That is happy he couldn't say that sentence...


872
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,550
You are so awake.


873
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,750
I just counted him buried...


874
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,450
The look between you and Ah Bing lasted for more than two minutes...


875
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,570
Yeah, this is the only time I can look at each other up close.


876
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,090
Okay.


877
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,930
Anyway.


878
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,550
So on this one you both are the same no points.


879
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,690
save you.


880
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:08,970
Excited.


881
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,430
Okay.


882
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,110
We have finished playing the three theater mini-games...


883
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,110
As a result, four people got the same score.


884
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,670
That means there are four losers...


885
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,110
The difference is...


886
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,710
Li Ying, Ah J, Ah Bing, and Ju Mi.


887
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,830
We are already standing in a group.


888
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,770
Ah J, congratulations.


889
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,490
And this position is not perfect.


890
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,470
Congratulations.


891
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,950
You don't have to lose as a host...


892
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,990
come here everyone


893
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,970
Behead, behead.


894
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,050
Finished playing with the three CAMs.


895
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,590
Do you think it was helpful for our show?


896
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,090
of course there is


897
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,330
We just lined up a dance right...


898
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,150
If you want to see it, we'll jump back to the show...


899
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:42,430
Nothing wrong.


900
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,350
We have click HAM, choreography instructor milk tea work.


901
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,790
Then we will also tell milk tea, milk tea we help you sort very unreasonable.


902
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,490
I think he is going to say that this dance is not my line...


903
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,630
Plea him guilty, do you know...


904
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,290
Finally, thank you to Edward Chung for letting us shoot the Party Game here.


905
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,690
You are such a hostage...


906
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,290
Okay,3,2,1.


907
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,650
Xue Jie Party Game, jump back to your sister Xue Jie.


908
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,330
Okay, rowing.

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,250
All together, all together, all together, all together.


910
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,750
Low platform, suitable for me.


911
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,650
All together.


912
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,190
All together.
